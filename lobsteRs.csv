,2019-07-05 12:20:57 -0500, ,"I find the omitted lines of thought as interesting as the included ones.,I’ll point out that my personal belief is that reality is hypothetical, and that in order to formulate that hypothesis, mathematical objects and logic are needed; thus, maths is more fundamental than reality. Further, , and ,.,I wonder what the author would think of the ,. It is possible to sit in quiet self-reflection and, as a result, become convinced of mathematical truths that were not previously known to be true. How? Sociology provides a hint with the concepts of parochiality and redundancy. Many different mathematicians study many different branches of maths, but maths is largely self-compatible, so that social interchange of memes between mathematicians suffices to generate new theorems of maths by synthetic and hybridized arguments. However, there’s a problem, still; how do we account for mathematicians like Gauss, Euler, Galois, Poincaré, Noether, Einstein, etc. being able to come up with wholly new perspectives? We can still imagine that they were influenced by their peers, but to what extent does the existence of a social pressure translate into maths theorems? Can we get more theorems from mathematicians just by applying more social demands?,The “philosopher’s take” is quite interestingly wrong. I will gladly admit that I have no idea why cooking rocks ought to lead to computation, and hardware is indeed mysterious. But software is treatable using standard information theory, talking of bits and leading up to formal abstract machines, and so there is no category mistake. Perhaps the mistake is in imagining that we can “formally verify a program”; indeed, what we formally verify is a , of the program, relative to some axioms and context. I don’t have access to the cited works, but the argument seems to be dismissable based on a surface-level reading. The cutting-edge ontology for correctness of formal proofs is based upon , and correctness of embedding. The bugs that a compiler can have are precisely the extra functionality introduced by a weird machine; the user’s buggy code provokes the compiler into entering weird states not in the original specification.,The “sociologist’s take” is specifically wrong, and not many lessons can be learned. The author simply hasn’t run across a table like , which shows that the claimed lone correspondence is actually only one element of a much bigger connection. Indeed, it is routine for category theorists to demonstrate the entirety of the connection by defining first a category or logic or language, and then completing the correspondence. As an example, , builds the type system, category, and even suggests a toy syntax.,The “cognitive scientist’s take” feels hopelessly lost. Here’s an aspect of lambda calculus not mentioned in the article. First, the informal version. Suppose that I can build widgets for you, but I need both a left piece and a right piece. If you give me a left piece, and then return later and give me a right piece, then I can build the widget when I get the second piece. Alternatively, you could wait until you have both pieces, and then give me both pieces at once, and I’ll build the widget at once. The formal version:,Is this physical experience needed to construct the lambda calculus? It’s certainly a physical experience which , the lambda calculus, but it also affirms the underlying Cartesian closed category.,Finally, what about anthropic bias? We cannot imagine what it is like to think with any hardware besides our own, and this limitation prevents us from conceptualizing some things in a way that leads to recursive unknowability.",Corbin,"{'age': '2019-07-05 04:09:41 -0500',

As far as I can tell, you haven’t changed their nature, just the symptom. There must be an underlying reason why the person is like this: Be it stress, disliking their job (but feeling trapped into it with no viable alternatives) or possibly inherent malice. If and only if the cause was stress induced by other people at the workplace, this alleviates the cause as well as the symptoms. Otherwise, you’ve merely shifted the problem on someone else, such as their family or random strangers. Possibly, lacking an outlet for their “assholery”, this might even intensify the outlash at others outside a workplace. I’m not sure what would actually fix this; possibly some trips to the psychiatrist and subsequent therapdy and medication?,Let’s consider the assumption that an “asshole” cannot be “fixed”. In that case, it is a fixed personality trait, likely rooting in inherent malice. This article makes the point that assholes should not be permitted to work in a workplace. At the same time, the assumption is that they’re irredeemable. Thus, they cannot work in anything but one-person self-employment scenarios, which is an economically unrealistic scenario for many people. Therefore, these people cannot be allowed to work at all according to this line to thinking. What does a society do with people that cannot work? Banishing them out of the country or outright killing them is apparently out of the question for the morals of society right now, so they’d have to join welfare. In a capitalist state, the question turns into whether, on a macroeconomic scale, putting “assholes” on welfare comes cheaper than keeping them in the workforce.,In either case, you have an unsolved problem.",xorhash,"{'age': '2019-07-04 15:56:06 -0500',

,These are all perfectly good ways for weeding out abusive people from a community. But the issue is that the resilient assholes simply aren’t the ones who ever get caught acting like this.,In private, , assholes spread false rumors about others and their work, but stand up for the work of their friends on their Twitter feeds. Between themselves, they intentionally ignore contributions from people they feel slighted or intimidated by. In public, however, they write Medium posts on how important it is to get more newcomers into open source and blame everyone around them for sexism, racism, discrimination etc.,In private, they only accept technical arguments from the people they want to impress, and ignore technical arguments from people they want to shut out, especially when that doesn’t agree with their perspective. In public, they shame others for not focusing their speech or conduct on technical substance and for not being inclusive.,In private, they maintain and encourage myths about those they have a vendetta against (for usually petty or delusional reasons) and promulgate them through their circle of influence, they gossip about how someone was a “diversity hire”. In public, they proclaim loudly on Twitter about how they’re leading a donation drive to a “Minorities in Tech” group.,Figuring out the obvious assholes has been a solved problem for years, if not decades. Any competent leader knows how to do that. But what about the resilient assholes, the ones resolutely after political capital and influence at all costs? What’s being done to deal with those people? From my perspective, they just thrive more year by year.",nadim,"{'age': '2019-07-04 15:56:06 -0500',

,
,Well, on XBox One, this was the opposite: we took the user research results on how people controlled apps via voice and gestures seriously, shipping what worked well as per the user research and the employee betas.,Working on the Skype for XBox One team, we ran many user research tests to see how people would use the app via controller, voice controls (“XBox, call Joe”) or gestures (using your hand to scroll and call someone, Minotiry report style). The results for voice were promising, for gesture, they were neutral. So we shipped it and after similar results all-round, XBox leadership decided voice control will be mandatory for all XBox apps, with gesture strongly suggested (for first-party apps, it was also mandatory). And no XBox will be sold without a Kinect.,It later turned out that voice worked well… initially. But for all users but the most power users, usage steadily dropped after the first few months, until people stopped using it completely. This did not come out on the user tests, as they were designed to be short. And it did also not come out on the company takehome beta - about 3,000 people using pre-release XBoxes in their homes, with strict confidentiality in place - as people were early adopters, continously showing off voice and gesture control.,By the time the data was clear, it was too late: Kinect was bundled with XBox. And it took years to de-bundle it. As both this article and my story shows, user research is not straightfoward.",gregdoesit,"{'age': '2019-07-04 19:03:49 -0500',

What I liked about the “Category Theory in 10 minutes” is that it helped me get an idea of what category theory is about and introduce some of the lingo that otherwise takes a long time to acquire (it’s only 22 pages long). As a point of comparison, The Category Theory For Programmers book is 515 pages long, the Seven Sketches in Compositionality book is 243 and the slide deck you shared is 209 – I’d like to see more short or medium-form introductions to category theory, so that it’s easier to dive into it.",sebastien,"{'age': '2019-07-04 15:51:17 -0500',
